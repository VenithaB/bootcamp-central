Welcome to the first virtual offering of the PSU Bioinformatics Data
Reproducibility Bootcamp!

**Logistics**

We will meet over Zoom. We will start each day at 8:30 AM Eastern and end at
5:00 PM Eastern, with multiple breaks throughout the day. You will receive the
Zoom meeting connection details via email.

**Setup**

During the bootcamp, we will use the Interactive Desktop provided by
the [ICDS-ACI][]. This means you do not need to install any software on
your personal computer prior to the bootcamp. To access the resources
provided by the ICDS-ACI, you need to follow these steps:

[icds-aci]: https://www.icds.psu.edu/

* For incoming graduate students, activate your PSU student account

* Enable [two-factor authentication][2fa] for your PSU account

    [2fa]: https://accounts.psu.edu/2fa

* [Request an ICDS-ACI account.][icds-aci-account] Use the research description
  "2020 Data Reproducibility Bootcamp" and list [PJ][pj] as your sponsoring
  account (ghp3)

[icds-aci-account]: https://accounts.aci.ics.psu.edu/

Please do this as soon as possible since it can take a few days for the account
request to process.

**Prequisites**

The prerequisites for the bootcamp include some basic familiarity with R, R
Markdown, and RStudio. You can read/watch the resources below to review this
material.

These videos from [MarinStatsLectures][] introduce the basics of R and RStudio:

The following short lessons on R Markdown cover the main topics you need to
know:

* [R Markdown - Code Chunks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)
* [R Markdown - Markdown Basics](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-8.html)

These cheat sheets go into way more depth than you will need for the bootcamp,
but they are a handy reference.
