## Zoom

We will meet over Zoom. We will start each day at 8:30 AM Eastern and end at
5:00 PM Eastern, with multiple breaks throughout the day. You will receive the
Zoom meeting connection details via email.

The exercises will be performed in breakout rooms of 3-4 participants each. You
are encouraged to share your screen to facilitate discussion.

Zoom polls will be used throughout the bootcamp to gain feedback on how the
exercises are going. The results are anonymous.
