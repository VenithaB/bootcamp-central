## GitHub Account

You will need an account on [GitHub][] for the section on version control.
Please create one prior to the bootcamp.

[GitHub]: https://github.com/

During the workflowr section, you will use password authentication to
communicate with GitHub. This is required to make the instructions the same for
everyone. For any real workflowr projects you create in the future, you can
customize workflowr to use your preferred Git/GitHub settings (e.g. [SSH
keys][workflowr-ssh]).

Because of this, please make sure:

1. You remember your GitHub password. You will need to type it out.

1. If you have configured two-factor authentication for your GitHub account,
   please temporarily disable it for Friday. If you don't disable it, you will
   need to generate a [Personal Access Token][github-pat] and copy-paste this instead of your
   password ([GitHub Instructions for authenticating with PAT][github-pat-copy-paste]).
