## Interactive Desktop

The bootcamp exercises will be completed on the ICDS-ACI Interactive Desktop
dedicated to this bootcamp (BDR Desktop). Prior to the start of the bootcamp,
please follow these instructions to confirm you are able to login and use the
Interactive Desktop. Because this is a desktop environment running in your
browser, copy-pasting is more cumbersome than usual, and will take some practice
to get used to.

1. On the homepage of this website, click on the [link to the Interactive
   Desktop](https://portal.aci.ics.psu.edu/).

    <img src="/static/img/2020/link-to-desktop.png"
         alt="Link to Interactive Desktop"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. Login with your PSU User ID and password.

         alt="PSU WebAccess Login"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. Authenticate with the two-factor authentication method of your choice.
   Recommended that you use Duo Push.

    <img src="/static/img/2020/psu-2fa.png"
         alt="Two-factor authentication"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. Click on the Interactive Apps menu in the navigation bar, and then choose BDR
   Desktop.

    <img src="/static/img/2020/choose-bdr-desktop.png"
         alt="Interactive Apps menu"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. Configure the following settings and then hit the blue Launch button:

    * **Desktop environment:** Gnome 2
    * **Allocation:** ghp3_c_t_lc_default
    * **Number of hours:** 8
    * **Node type:** ACI-b Legacy Core

    **Note:** During the bootcamp you'll want to choose 8 hours in order to
    avoid having to wait to launch another session. But for a quick test, choose
    1 hour (this should also help it launch faster).

    <img src="/static/img/2020/bdr-desktop-settings.png"
         alt="BDR Desktop settings"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. You should see a green banner stating the session was successfully created
   and below you should see that the session is "Queued". You may need to wait a
   few minutes for your session to be ready.

    <img src="/static/img/2020/bdr-desktop-queued.png"
         alt="BDR Desktop session queued"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. When your session is ready, click on the blue button to start the Interactive
   Desktop in a new browser tab. Also note the white button that says "View
   Only". If you need help troubleshooting, you can share that link so that
   others can view exactly what you see.

    <img src="/static/img/2020/bdr-desktop-launch.png"
         alt="BDR Desktop session ready to launch"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. Open the terminal. Click on Applications in the navigation bar, then System
   Tools, and then choose Terminal.

    <img src="/static/img/2020/open-terminal.png"
         alt="Open the terminal"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. To copy text out of the Interactive Desktop, first right click and choose
   Copy. You may also be able to use Ctrl+C. This adds the text to the
   Interactive Desktop's Clipboard.

    <img src="/static/img/2020/copy-1.png"
         alt="Copy text to clipboard"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. To access the Clipboard, click on the tab on the left-hand side. This will
   expand a menu. Click on the Clipboard icon to display the copied text. From
   here you can select the text, right click, and copy it (or use Ctrl+C). Now
   you can paste this text elsewhere on your computer.

    <img src="/static/img/2020/copy-from-clipboard.png"
         alt="Copy text from clipboard"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. To paste text into the Interactive Desktop, first expand the Clipboard from
   the left-side menu and paste the text to the Clipboard.

    <img src="/static/img/2020/paste-to-clipboard.png"
         alt="Paste text to the clipboard"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. Next minimize the side menu, and paste from the Clipboard into the
   Interactive Desktop by right clicking and selecting Paste. If Paste is greyed
   out, try right clicking a second time. You may also be able to use the
   keyboard shortcut Shift+Insert.

    <img src="/static/img/2020/paste-from-clipboard.png"
         alt="Paste text from the clipboard"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />

1. If you made it this far, you're ready for the bootcamp! Feel free to
   experiment more with the Interactive Desktop. When you're finished, go ahead
   and delete the session to free up computational resources.

         alt="Delete Interactive Desktop session"
         style="display: block;
                margin: 25px auto;
                width: 75%;
                border: black solid 1px;"
    />
