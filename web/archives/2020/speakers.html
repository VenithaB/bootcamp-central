    {% speaker name="Justin Petucci" website="https://www.icds.psu.edu/computing-services/rise/rise-team-members/" title="An Overview of ICDS Research Computing Services" recording=True description="This session will overview the services that ICDS provides to PSU researchers through our Advanced CyberInfrastructure (ACI). ICDS-ACI serves as the backbone of our traditional HPC system including our web based graphical portal, our High Performance Research Cloud (HPRC), scientific gateways, and storage services. In addition, non-ACI services such as advanced technical consulting with the Research Innovations with Scientists and Engineers (RISE) will be discussed." %}

    {% speaker name="Arun Srinivasan" website="https://science.psu.edu/index.php/stat/people/uus91" title="Out of Tune: Tuning Parameters and Reproducible Machine Learning" recording=True description="With the increasing availability of data, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to study questions in biology. While much attention has been placed on the influence of misinterpreting correlation and p-values, the choice of tuning parameters when running a model can drastically affect the outcome. This talk will focus on how important reporting the thought process behind the selection tuning parameters used in machine learning models is when striving for reproducibility of data analysis." %}

    {% speaker name="Matthew Jensen" website="https://autism.bx.psu.edu/" title="Constructing and maintaining reproducible bioinformatics pipelines in your research" recording=True description="The talk will cover how to assemble bioinformatic pipelines for genomic data analysis from different softwares, maintain the pipelines for future use by yourself or other lab mates, and prepare your pipelines for posting on GitHub (i.e. code commenting, README pages, example data) upon publication of your work. The talk will be based on my own experiences working with analysis of genomics datasets (i.e. whole-genome sequencing, RNA-Sequencing), and includes an example from my early PhD career where my lack of experience led to some irreproducible RNA-Seq results from using two different pipelines." %}
