### Session 3: Workflow management by Snakemake

In this session we will go through Snakemake, a popular workflow management tool. We will talk about what kind of features should be expected from a workflow, and how to realize them by Snakemake.

A toy example workflow will be built step by step during the presentation, and participants will also have the chance to work on small tasks by their own.
