### Session 3: Workflow management by Snakemake

#### speaker: Jianyu Yang

In this session we will go through [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a popular workflow management tool. We will talk about what kind of features should be expected from a workflow, and how to realize them by Snakemake.

A toy [example workflow](https://github.com/yztxwd/Snakemake_workshop/tree/development) will be built step by step during the presentation, and participants will also have the chance to work on small tasks by their own.
