## GitHub Account

You will need an account on [GitHub][] for the section on version control.
Please create one prior to the bootcamp.

[GitHub]: https://github.com/

During the worflow section, you will use password authentication to
communicate with GitHub. This is required to make the instructions the same for
everyone. 

Because of this, please make sure:

1. You remember your GitHub password. You will need to type it out.

1. If you have configured two-factor authentication for your GitHub account,
   please temporarily disable it for Friday. If you don't disable it, you will
   need to generate a [Personal Access Token][github-pat] and copy-paste this instead of your
   password ([GitHub Instructions for authenticating with PAT][github-pat-copy-paste]).
