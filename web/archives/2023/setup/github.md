## Git & GitHub Account

You will need [Git][] installed and an account on [GitHub][] for the section on version control.

[Git]: https://git-scm.com/
[GitHub]: https://github.com/

Some systems come with git already installed, check it in command line interface by `git --version`. If not, refer to [install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for instructions.

During the worflow section, you will use password authentication to
communicate with GitHub. This is required to make the instructions the same for
everyone. 

**Any issue on above two steps, feel free to contact Maxwell Konnaris: mak6930@psu.edu**
