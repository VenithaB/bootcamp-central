 ## ICDS-ACI Account

During the bootcamp, we will use resources provided by the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS). To access the resources provided by the ICDS-ACI, you need to follow these steps:

* For incoming graduate students, activate your PSU student account

* Enable [two-factor authentication](https://accounts.psu.edu/2fa) for your PSU account

* [Request an ICDS-ACI account.](https://accounts.aci.ics.psu.edu/) Use the research description: "2023 Data Reproducibility Bootcamp" and list [Dr. David Koslicki](https://www.huck.psu.edu/people/david-koslicki) (dmk333) as your sponsoring account.

Please do this **by the end of Friday (2022/08/07)** since it can take a few days for the account request to process.

If you already have access to the cluster, none of this is required.
